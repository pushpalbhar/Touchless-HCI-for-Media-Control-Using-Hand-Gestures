# Touchless-HCI-for-Media-Control-Using-Hand-Gestures
This system implements a touchless Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) mechanism for controlling a media player using hand gestures. The solution leverages MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition, deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 (RPI5) as an edge computing device.

Project Summary: Hand Gesture HCI for Media Control High-Efficiency Edge-Inference on Raspberry Pi 5

OVERVIEW This project implements a Natural User Interface (NUI) for touchless media control. It utilizes 21-point skeletal tracking and a Hierarchical Finite State Machine (HFSM) to provide near-zero latency command mapping on edge devices.

DUAL-MODE CONTROL ARCHITECTURE The system distinguishes between two primary interaction types: • Static Control: Discrete state mapping (e.g., Open Palm for Play/Pause). Uses a temporal median filter to ensure intent stability. • Dynamic Control: Continuous modulation for variables like Volume and Scrubbing. Uses an anchored control loop to calculate displacement (∆) for real-time frequency scaling.

TECHNICAL FEATURES • 4-Layer Pipeline: Signal Conditioning, Feature Extraction (MediaPipe), State-Machine Logic, and Asynchronous Execution. • Scale Invariance: Centroid-based normalization allows operation from 30cm to 240cm. • Temporal Filtering: 4-frame median filtering along with Exponential Moving Average(EMA) prevents inference jitter • Buffer Flushing: Immediate queue reset during intent shifts for fast transitions.

PERFORMANCE DATA • Accuracy: 96.0% + across all gestures. • Throughput: 20+ FPS on Raspberry Pi 5. • CPU Load: 16.9% (Peak Core Load). • Latency: 160ms – 180ms total system lag.

GESTURE MAPPING • Activation: Thumbs Up (Unlock System). • VLC Controls gestures: Open Palm,Index, Spidey,Victory,Nice,Quad,Fist • VLC Controls features: Play/Pause,Mute/Unmute,Volume control,Video nagivation seeking,Exit,Restart,Playback Speed control,Playlist Control(prev/next video,shuffle and play in a loop),Miniplayer Videoes,Fullscreen Toggle,Aspect ratio changing,Screenshot Screenrecording

REQUIREMENTS • Hardware: Raspberry Pi 5, Lapcam web camera HD 720P LWC-042 (or equivalent). • Libraries: MediaPipe, OpenCV, Pynput, NumPy.
